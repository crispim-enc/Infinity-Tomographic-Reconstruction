# Infinity-Tomographic-Reconstruction
Tomographic reconstruction for diferent imaging modalities (PET, SPECT, CT and Compton)
Image Reconstruction Framework for PET/CT and SPECT

🚀 Overview

This repository provides a robust and modular image reconstruction framework designed for Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Computed Tomography (CT), and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). By integrating state-of-the-art algorithms, this framework enhances image quality, reduces noise, and improves computational efficiency, making it ideal for clinical and research applications.
🧩 Features

    Multi-Modality Support: Seamlessly handles PET, CT, and SPECT data.
    Customizable Pipelines: Modular design enables easy integration of new reconstruction algorithms.
    GPU Acceleration: Optimized for high-performance computation using CUDA/OpenCL.
    AI-Driven Enhancements: Incorporates deep learning techniques to improve image resolution and reduce artifacts.
    Open Data Support: Compatible with DICOM, NIfTI, and other medical imaging standards.
    Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

🔍 Usage
Command Line Interface (CLI)

Run a PET/CT reconstruction using the CLI:

python src/main.py --input data/sample_pet.dcm --output results/reconstructed_pet.dcm --mode pet

Python API

Use the framework in your custom scripts:

from reconstruction_framework import PETReconstructor

reconstructor = PETReconstructor(config="config/pet_config.json")
image = reconstructor.reconstruct("data/sample_pet.dcm")
image.save("results/reconstructed_pet.dcm")
