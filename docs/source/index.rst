Infinity Tomographic Reconstruction
==============================================

The **Infinity Tomographic Reconstruction** is a Python package that provides a set of tools for parametric 3D iterative
tomographic reconstruction mainly listmode and GPU based.
(Some packages are still in being repurposed and restructured to have a broader use. Although some are already included,
some features that are available can run different from the intended use.)

The documentation is not complete yet, but I am working on it. The package is moving to a openSource release,
but the code is still in a private repository. To that reason the package installation is limited to the ones that have access to it.
